Awesome Pawsome Game That I'm makin'


Essentially, I wanted to flesh out my abilities and talents.

I love video games and I felt like this would be a tough challenge with little to no experience.

Before completeing this project, I had absolutely no prior knowledge of video games. Now I have a small amount of fleshed out knowledge using 
libraries such as Pygame, tkinter, turtle

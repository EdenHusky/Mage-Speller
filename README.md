# Mage-Speller

Essentially, I wanted to flesh out my abilities and talents.

I love video games and I felt like this would be a tough challenge with little to no experience.

Before completeing this project, I had absolutely no prior knowledge of video game development. Now I have a small amount of fleshed out knowledge using 
libraries such as Pygame, tkinter, turtle. Once a python IDE version has been created, I intend on moving this development to flask to make it easier to access without having to clone the code here.
